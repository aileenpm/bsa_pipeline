This is a list of scripts I've used for Bulk Segregant Analysis of F2 population generated from crossing two mustard (Brassica rapa) cultivars with different flowering time phenotypes. 

The aim of this analysis is to identify genomic loci within the alternative parent (Sarisha-14) with SNPs associated to its earlier flowering phenotype, and SNP annotation using SnpEff [1] to predict the impacts of these SNPs on downstream processing of genes within these genomic loci.
